# QTCasinoGame
## Learn and practice classic casino games in QT!

This educational casino simulator was my group's final project for CS3505 (Spring 2023). Some of the skills I learned or refined from working on this project are as follows:
- Scrum project flow
- C++ developement
- QT developement
- Developement with Box2D physics engine
- Graphic design
- Working on a large-scale project with a team

I am still working on this project on my own and hope to implement more classic casino games!
